# wagtail2
## My own wagtail 2 site.

Based on [bakerydemo](https://github.com/wagtail/bakerydemo) for wagtail 2. I've included some mods over [Puput Blog](https://github.com/APSL/puput).

It has also some experiments like:
* Icon picker on admin interface.
* Recaptcha for forms.
* twitter panel on pages.
* Disqus comments for the blog
* TinyMCE editor (+ some WhitelistRules for bootstrap 4)

Template is based on [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com) but it has some adjustments like [Creative Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com) free bootstrap themes. SCSS is available.

Next steps:
1. Multilingual layer.
2. Docker functionality.
3. Go to Production, now my site is down.

Enjoy ;)
