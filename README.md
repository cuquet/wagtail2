# wagtail2
## My own wagtail 2 site.

Based on [bakerydemo](https://github.com/wagtail/bakerydemo) for wagtail 2. I've included some mods over [Puput Blog](https://github.com/APSL/puput).

It has also some experiments like:
* Icon picker on admin interface (icons available in menubar)
* Recaptcha for forms.
* twitter panel on pages.
* Disqus comments for the blog
* TinyMCE editor (+ some WhitelistRules for bootstrap 4)
* Multilingual layer based on [wagtail modeltranslation](https://github.com/infoportugal/wagtail-modeltranslation).
with own tab interface to manage languages (works on snippets, inline panels, ...)

Template is based on [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com) but it has some adjustments like [Creative Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com) free bootstrap themes. SCSS is available.

Next steps:
1. Docker functionality.
2. Go to Production, now my site is down (now works with docker)
3. Enable API.

Enjoy ;)
